# Amazon Reviews - Analysis of Kitchen Purchases

## Overview
Our company, BigMarket, is a start up company that helps other companies with marketing efforts.  $ellBy, one of the clients, is about to release a large amount of kitchen products on Amazon.  They are wanting to know how the reviews of their products compare to similar products of their compeditors.  They are also looking to start a points program to their loyal customers.  

This review is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program and compare to the reviews of SellBy to see how their product may perform and if a customer loyatly program would be profitable for the company.

_The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like $ellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review._
